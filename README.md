# [Train-Scheduler](https://alejosjen.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)


This JS program takes a train attendant's information about known train times and calculates when the next train is expected.

For styling, I used Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts.

A Firebase database is used to store and retreive the inputted information.

The Momentjs library is used to:
- figure the difference of the current time compared to the first departure
- record when the next train is expected and how many minutes away it is
- format the display times into hours and minutes 

I used jQuery to append the information to the browser.

Thanks for reading, any kind comments and constructive suggestions are always appreciated.
